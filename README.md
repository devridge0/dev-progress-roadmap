# Dev Progress Roadmap Practice

This repository is dedicated to tracking my daily practice as I follow a developer progress roadmap. Each day focuses on small, consistent improvements in coding, version control, and documentation habits.

## Roadmap Goals

- Strengthen Git and commit discipline
- Improve code quality and readability
- Learn new technologies and frameworks progressively
- Maintain daily progress and reflections

## Daily Practice Format

Each day includes:

1. **Small code change or update**  
2. **Properly formatted commit**  
3. **README update with notes**
